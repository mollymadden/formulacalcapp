The app is a Baby Formula Calculator that helps parents calculate how many milliliters of formula one tin of formula powder will make. The user inputs the weight of the formula tin, weight of a single scoop, volume of a single serving, and their baby's average daily intake. Based on these inputs, the app calculates the amount of formula that can be made from one tin, as well as the number of days the tin will last. The user can choose to use either the metric or US unit system. The app features a clean and simple interface with inputs for the various quantities and a button to perform the calculation. The result is displayed on the page in milliliters, with an option to display it in fluid ounces if the user has selected the US unit system.
